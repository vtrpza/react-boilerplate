React Boilerplate: A Quickstart Guide
The React Boilerplate is a Next.js project initialized with create-next-app. This boilerplate is designed to help developers quickly set up and run a new Next.js project.

Getting Started
To get started with the React Boilerplate, you first need to run the development server. This can be done using either npm or yarn:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Once the server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the result.

The main page of the application can be edited by modifying the pages/index.js file. Any changes made to this file will automatically update the page.

API Routes
API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. You can edit this endpoint in the pages/api/hello.js file.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Any files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

You can also visit the Next.js GitHub repository to provide feedback and contributions.

Deployment
For deployment, the easiest way is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js. For more details, you can refer to the Next.js deployment documentation.

This React Boilerplate provides a solid foundation for starting a new Next.js project, making it easier for developers to focus on creating their application.
